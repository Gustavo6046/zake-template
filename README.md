# My Zake Project Name

This is a template for a ZDoom project that uses
[Zake](https://www.github.com/zeta-group/ZDCode)
as a packaging system.

This is more convenient, both for developers, users,
and for continuous integration alike. Hooray!

## Features

* Stuff.
* More stuff!
* Lots of stuff!

## Building

1. Install [ZDCode](https://www.github.com/zeta-group/ZDCode),
   which comes with Zake.
2. Run `zdcode` without arguments on the folder.
3. ???
4. Profit!

Built packages will be in the `pkg/` folder.

## Licensing

The [template](https://www.github.com/zeta-group/zake-template)
is under the MIT License, and so is
[ZDCode](https://www.github.com/zeta-group/ZDCode) (and by extension
Zake).

That does not mean that projects using this template have
to be licensed under MIT. That said, if you do change your project's
license, don't forget to replace the `LICENSE` file in your project! :)
